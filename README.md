Methods for gathering, processing, storing, and analyzing financial data on equities.

Finance
-----------------------

Tracking investments across multiple accounts is challenging. You might have a taxable brokerage account, a Roth IRA, a Traditional IRA, a Traditional 401k, and a 403(b), etc. Quarterly statements don't really keep you up-to-speed on what's happening with your portfolio and the market. This repository aggregates ledger data (what was purchased, date of purchase, amount purchased, running tally of cost and holdings) across multiple accounts, gathers closing price data for each equity for every date of account ownership, and calculates both daily and summary level statistics.


Usage

* Explore the `Data Mining and Processing` folder to find code to gather the data.
